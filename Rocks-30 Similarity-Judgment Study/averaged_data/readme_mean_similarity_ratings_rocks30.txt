The file "mean_similarity_ratings_rocks30.txt" provides the averaged similarity judgment matrix computed from the individual-subject similarity ratings.  The entry in cell i-j is the averaged similarity rating between the rock that represented subtype i and the rock that represented subtype j. (The analysis did not distinguish between the ordering, i.e., the left-right placement, of i and j, so the matrix is symmetric;  that is, the entry in cell j-i is the same as the entry in cell i-j.)  The first entry in each row gives the subtype number (i) for that row; the remaining 30  entries in row i give the averaged similarity ratings between subtype i and each of the 30 subtypes.  Subjects did not rate the self-similarity between rock i and rock i;  the entries in the diagonal cells of the matrix [each cell i-i] are set at 9.99, which serves as a placeholder. Because each subject provided a single similarity judgment between each subtype i and each subtype j, and there were 71 subjects included in the analysis, each cell entry is based on 71 observations.
